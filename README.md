Local Gem, 
a web application that helps users discover and explore local businesses, restaurants, and attractions. The app can provide a platform for users to find, review, and share experiences about different places in their area.

- Back-end repo: https://github.com/AnnaKiira/local-gem-backend

Technologies used:
1. MongoDB
2. Express
3. React.js
4. Node.js
5. JSX
6. Bootstrap
7. SCSS & CSS

My responsibilities included: 
- Authentication implementation on the frontend side (authentication service, signup & signin forms and nonprotected route paths).
- Creating the landing page.
- Building the image upload functionality.
We collaborated on backend development and styling together.

Key Learnings:
- This was our first (and last) group project in the bootcamp. It was cool to work with others on code, but it wasn't always easy since we were all remote. We couldn't just look over each other's shoulders to see what we were doing. We talked a lot throughout the day, but we really had to stay organized to keep things running smoothly for the whole week.
- We learned a lot about using different branches for the parts we were each working on. It was tricky at first, but we got better at committing our own stuff and then merging it all together. It was good practice for working on bigger projects in the future.

Future enhancements:
- Favorites functionality, allowing users to favorite posts they like or want to save. This can create a collection of interesting places for each user.
- Google Places API. Implement precise mapping of post locations, so each user doesn't have to manually write in the address.
- Adding a search bar and filtering option to help users easily find specific places. This would be useful if a user is planning a trip and for example are looking up museums or beaches for a vacation.
